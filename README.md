# Northeast-Housing-Price-Prediction-Model

This model was made with vast amounts of housing market data from Redfin (an online real estate marketplace) dating back to 2017-Present. The main purpose of this model was originally meant to give my dad a Real Estate Salesperson/Investor a gauge as to which real estate properties could potentially turn out to be profitable in the longterm as well as the price projections if held long term or short term. This was my very first time working with a model, but I'm excited to share that we've recieved a staggering 83% accuracy with the models predictive capabilities, with an overall predictive accuracy of 83% (keep in consideration that the context is about housing prices) and far surpassing baseline models of 91% in MAE reduction.
